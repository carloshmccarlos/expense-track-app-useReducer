## State Management

- **Actions in Reducer**
   - `select`: Select an expense for viewing in detail or updating.
   - `add`: Add a new expense to the list.
   - `delete`: Delete the selected expense.
   - `update`: Update the details of the selected expense.
   - `viewAdd`, `viewUpdate`, `viewDetail`: Change the current view to add, update, or detail respectively.
